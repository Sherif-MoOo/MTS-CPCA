I couldn't find suitable framework that deals with MTS-CPCA so I'll build the algorithm from scratch

What's MTS?

MTS (Multivariate time series) is an important type of data that
is indispensable in a variety of domains as  medicine 
domain which is the evolution of a group of synchronous
variables over a duration of time as shown in the figure and
there is a lot of effort given due to the expensive of gathering 
these labeled data to be able to offer a method gives a reliable 
accuracy by only using a limited amount of these data.
